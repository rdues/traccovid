# TRAC:COVID

This is the repo for the AHRC funded TRAC:COVID project.
The project collected and processed Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic.
See traccovid.com or https://www.bcu.ac.uk/english/research/english-linguistics/rdues/research-projects/trac-covid for details.

The TRAC:COVID dashboard combines an ElasticSearch database with a Plotly Dash frontend.
Twitter data was sourced from the Historical PowerTrack API, which is the data format processed by the import functions.

The dashboard source files include the visualisations and the full text from the traccovid.com website.
