<p>
	Birmingham City University is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.  This accessibility statement covers the pages that sit on the traccovid.com website.

<p>
	We strive to create a website that can be used by as many people as possible. We understand the importance of creating content with accessibility in mind.

<p>
	If you are unable to access content on our website, we will try to provide alternative formats to mitigate this.
